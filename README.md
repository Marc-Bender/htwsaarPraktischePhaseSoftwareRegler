# htwsaarPraktischePhaseSoftwareRegler

Develloped during the practical phase of my studies. Implements a software PID controller with variable Kp, Ki and Kd factors and 
with the ability to decide whether to put the differentiator in the feedback loop or to put it in the more traditional textbook position 
(that is together with the P and the I part of the controller).
